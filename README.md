# **Day 29: Collaboration project - Daily Calendar of the 30-Day Cloud Challenge**

The HTML and CSS code creates a visually appealing calendar interface to help users track their progress in the 30-day cloud challenge, providing an intuitive way to organize and manage daily tasks and goals.

**How It's Made:**
Tech used: HTML, CSS.


The calendar is made using HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling. HTML is used to define the layout of the calendar grid, with each day represented as a separate element. CSS is then applied to customize the appearance of the calendar, including colors, borders, and fonts.

**Optimizations**

I would come back to this project so JavaScript can be incorporated for interactivity, such as highlighting the current day or allowing users to mark completed tasks.


**Lessons Learned:**

One key lesson learned from creating the calendar project is the importance of planning and organization. Before diving into coding, it's essential to outline the structure and functionality of the calendar thoroughly. This includes determining the layout, and deciding on the level of interactivity. Additionally, maintaining clean and modular code helps make the project more manageable and easier to maintain in the long run.
